# Webscrape Tutorial 

I followed along to Phuc from Coding Dojo's [Webscraping with Python tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQgXKtPSzUI). Some of the code needed to be updated, which I did here.

## Running the program 

Clone the project on your local machine by forking and cloning this respository. Copy the SSH link, open your terminal, and type:

```$ git clone <SSH link>```

If you are following Phuc's tutorial, you should have already downloaded [anacanda](https://www.anaconda.com/) and [beautiful soup](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/). If not, I recommend downloading the two before proceeding. 

**On a mac** 
Open the project folder and right-click the **script.py** file. Open with the **Python Launcher** option.

**On a windows** 
Open the project folder and right-click the **script.py** file. Open a new terminal and write the following code: 

```$ python webscrape.py```
